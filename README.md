One in the Chamber is a game based off the original HiveMC game.
Each player gets one bow and an arrow, they can shoot the bow as many times as they want.
Each time a player is shot, they "die", and then respawn in a different area around the map. 
The winner is the person with the most kills in that game.
You also get ranks which are configurable based on points.
